title: "PfP: Pain-free Passwords 2.1.0"
date: 2018-03-08
---

The major change in this release is the new [sync functionality](/documentation/sync/) via storage providers Dropbox and Google Drive ([issue #24](https://github.com/palant/pfp/issues/24), [#83](https://github.com/palant/pfp/issues/83), [#84](https://github.com/palant/pfp/issues/84)). It can be used as an automatic backup, but also to sync changes between multiple devices.

## Other changes

* Backups created with a different master password can be imported, generated passwords will be converted into stored passwords then ([issue #69](https://github.com/palant/pfp/issues/69)).
* Pop-up now allows selecting a different website and will display an autocomplete list to aid site selection ([issue #52](https://github.com/palant/pfp/issues/52)).
* Better support for passwords not bound to a website, one can select the special *(none)* site name from the autocomplete list ([issue #41](https://github.com/palant/pfp/issues/41)).
* Keyboard navigation: pressing Escape won't close the pop-up but trigger the Cancel button instead ([doesn't work in Firefox](https://bugzil.la/1443758)).
