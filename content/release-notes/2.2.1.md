title: "PfP: Pain-free Passwords 2.2.1"
---

This release fixes display of sync errors in Firefox on Android ([issue #105](https://github.com/palant/pfp/issues/105)). In addition, there is a number of minor improvements:

* Esc key will no longer lock passwords, previously this made it impossible to close pop-up via keyboard without locking.
* Improved styling of unexpected errors in pop-up, no overlap with the tab strip any more.
* Made sure a field gets keyboard focus after recovery code is entered.
* Improved display of recovery code errors, particularly wrong format version.
* Made the user interface more accessible for screen readers.
* Improved localization approach, each component now has a separate localization file.
