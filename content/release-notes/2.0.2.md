For the first time, there is now a public release for Microsoft Edge. A number of work-arounds for Edge bugs has been implemented (some limitations still remain), at least Edge 41 is required. In addition, an incompatibility with older Firefox versions has been resolved ([issue #78](https://github.com/palant/pfp/issues/78)).
