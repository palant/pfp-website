By default, PfP will lock your passwords after 10 minutes of inactivity. In order to access your passwords, you have to enter the main password again. This is inconvenient, so why is it doing this?

Once you've entered your main password, all passwords stored in PfP are unlocked. Anybody sitting in front of your device at that moment can retrieve any or all of them. That's perfectly fine of course as long as that anybody is you. But what if you left your device unattended? Do you always lock your device when leaving? And if not, what it your co-workers, friends or even children open up PfP while you aren't there?

If that isn't a scenario that worries you, feel free to head over to the PfP options (cogwheel tab in the PfP pop-up) and increase auto-lock delay or even disable this feature altogether. Otherwise it's probably better to keep the default settings, the chances that both your device and PfP will be left unlocked at the same time will be rather slim then.
