## Website

This website does not collect or process any personal data in the sense of the General Data Protection Regulation.

### PfP: Pain-free Passwords browser extension

All data managed by PfP: Pain-free Passwords stays on your computer.

The legacy extension (PfP: Pain-free Passwords 2.x) will upload data to a third party (safely encrypted) if you set up sync yourself. In that case, the privacy policy of your storage provider (such as Dropbox or Google Drive) applies. This functionality is no longer present starting with PfP: Pain-free Passwords 3.0.
